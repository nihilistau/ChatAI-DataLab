# Archived notebooks

This directory mirrors the historical DataLab notebooks. All active work now lives under `kitchen/notebooks/` so Kitchen remains the single source of truth for recipes, telemetry explorers, and Papermill entry points.

Use `legacy/datalab/notebooks/` when you need to inspect a frozen copy of an earlier run. New edits should target `kitchen/notebooks/` instead.
